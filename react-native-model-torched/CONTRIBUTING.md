# Contributing to React Native PyTorch Core
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Our Development Process
We use GitHub issues and pull requests to keep track of bug reports and contributions from the community. All changes from engineers at Facebook will sync to GitHub through a bridge with Facebook's internal source control. Changes from the community are handled through GitHub pull requests. Once a change made on GitHub is approved, it will first be imported into Facebook's internal source control and tested against Facebook's codebase. Once merged at Facebook, the change will eventually sync back to GitHub as a single commit once it has passed Facebook's internal tests.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
